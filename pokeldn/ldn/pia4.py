"""Pia version 4 packet header and message framing - the wire format Sword/Shield speaks.

Read off the game's own deserializer at `main` 0x1774730 and then MEASURED against 484
packets a retail Sword broadcast at us while we held a seat in its LDN session.
Every one of them authenticated.

    off  size  field                            parser evidence
    0x00  4    magic 0x32AB9864, big-endian     the same magic as 5.27-6.32
    0x04  1    0x80 (encrypted) | version (4)   three validators check (byte & 0x7f) == 4
    0x05  1    connection id                    0 on every console packet; docs/pia.md, Version 4
    0x06  2    packet id, big-endian            0 = unsequenced, always accepted
    0x08  8    AES-GCM nonce, a counter
    0x10  16   AES-GCM tag, NOT truncated
    0x20  ...  ciphertext

WHAT VERSION 4 SHARES WITH 5.27-5.45, and it is nearly everything that matters: the session key is
`pia5.ldn_session_key` over the advertisement's session parameter, and the IV is `pia5.gcm_iv` -
three bytes of the station CRC, one byte of source id, then the header's own eight-byte nonce. The
version byte and the header layout are the whole difference, which is why this module is fifty
lines and not a second protocol stack.

THE MESSAGE FRAMING IS 5.27's, PLUS ONE FIELD. A message header is presence-flagged the same way,
and version 4 carries an extra eight-byte source id after the destination, so the header is 24
bytes rather than 16. FACT: 24 + size, padded to a multiple of four, accounts for all 484 payloads
exactly, with nothing but 0xFF after it. DEDUCTION: which presence bit owns that field - every
packet in the capture carries the same presence byte (0x7f), so the capture cannot separate them.
