"""Pia 5.29-5.43's reliable sliding window - protocol 0x7c, and where BDSP's game data is.

It parses version 4 with no change: a retail Sword's own reliable
messages read field for field through `parse()` - flags 0x0F on the first and 0x07 after it, stream
0, payload size 6, sequence 1..20, lowest-pending stuck at 1, zero destination bits, a 9-byte
header and a six-byte game payload `61 00 00 00 0a 00`. It sent 1637 messages of 20 distinct
sequence ids in 90 seconds, the earlier ids more often than the later ones, which is one
retransmit train per unacknowledged sequence: nothing of ours has ever acked this protocol.

`reliable.py` is the SAME idea for Pia 6.32 (the GBA app) and its header is a different shape; do
not reach for one while reading the other. This module is the 5.29-5.43 wrapper, which the wiki
"Reliable Sliding Window" describes and BDSP's own code corrects in two places.

THE MESSAGE HEADER (parse main.bin 0x0159756c, build 0x01597364, size 0x015977f0):

    0x0  1  flags                      the FLAG_* bits below
    0x1  1  stream id                  AND, on a RESET, a COUNTER - see below
    0x2  2  payload size, big-endian   refused at 0x5a1 or more
    0x4  2  sequence id, big-endian
    0x6  2  lowest sequence id pending ack, big-endian
    0x8  1  number of destination bits (N)   refused at 0x20 or more
    0x9  4 * ceil(N / 32)  destination bitmap words, big-endian
            payload

**The header is 9 or 13 bytes, not the 8 or 12 the wiki says** - the wiki's own field list runs
through offset 0x8, and `GetSize` is `9 + (((N + 0x1f) >> 3) & 0x3c)`. And N must be **strictly
less than 32**, where the wiki says "not higher than 32": both the parser and the builder branch on
`cmp #0x20 / b.lo`. Against a published reference, the binary wins.

THE ACK PAYLOAD, sent when FLAG_APPLICATION_DATA is clear (parse 0x01596fa4, build 0x0159718c,
size 0x0159716c = `2 + 21 * n`):

    0x0  1  UNKNOWN - the byte at AckMessage + 8. Neither the constructor nor the one-entry
            builder writes it, and no capture holds an ack, so it is not read yet
    0x1  1  entry count n, refused at 0x21 or more
    0x2  21 * n  entries, each:
            0x0  1   stream id
            0x1  2   acknowledgement id, big-endian
            0x3  2   the window's own field 0x50, big-endian - it is filed per station at
                     protocol + 0x7b8 and is HYPOTHESIS: the sender's lowest pending id
            0x5  16  acknowledgement mask, sent as stored

The wiki's "Ack Data" is the 5.18 shape (19-byte entries, always 32 of them). 5.29-5.43 carries an
explicit count and one more halfword per entry.

**THE BYTE AT 0x1 IS NOT ONLY A STREAM ID.** On a message carrying FLAG_RESET the handler
(main.bin 0x0159f9b4) reads it as a reset COUNTER and requires it to be exactly one more than the
value it holds for that station: `stream_id == record[0x1e]` is rejected outright at 0x0159fa24 and
`stream_id != record[0x1e] + 1` at 0x0159fa4c. A reset numbered 0 against a stored 0 is therefore
thrown away in silence, which is what five swept framings each did while the framing was
never the thing being measured. Before any of that the handler needs `record[0x1f]` non-zero, an
active-station flag we do not set.

**THE ACK, MEASURED OFF THE CONSOLE.** Sending the console application data made it answer,
and its answer is the shape no amount of reading the builder had settled:

    00 00 0017 ffff 0003 00   00 01   00 0002 0001  00 * 16

a header with **no flags at all**, stream 0, **sequence id 0xFFFF** - a control message carries no
sequence of its own - and the lowest id it is still waiting on; then the payload, whose first byte
is **0** and whose entry acknowledges `ack_id = highest received + 1` with the halfword before the
mask holding `ack_id - 1`. That is the reply to two application messages of ours, sequence 0 and 1.
