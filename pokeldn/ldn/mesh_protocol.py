"""Pia's Mesh Protocol - protocol 0x18, the membership layer above the station handshake.

The order a joiner goes through, and each step is a different protocol:

    LDN association            a seat on the radio; the game sees nothing
    Local Protocol   0x24      the host's update session, and the ack that stops it
    Station Protocol 0x14      the connection request, and the acceptance that names the host
    Mesh Protocol    0x18      THIS: the join request that puts a station IN the mesh

BDSP advertises mesh protocol version 3 in its connection response, which the wiki pins to Pia
5.30-5.45 - so the version numbers themselves date the library, and every structure here is the
5.31-5.45 one.

The join request is six bytes and says almost nothing: a type, the station index 253 that means
"not in a mesh yet", and an ack id. It is retransmitted every 500 ms until acknowledged, and Pia
gives up after ten seconds. The response carries the whole mesh - every station's location and
index, possibly split across fragments.

**A MESH MESSAGE IS ACKNOWLEDGED ON THE STATION PROTOCOL, NOT ON THIS ONE.** The wiki's type table
has no ack, and BDSP's own code has no builder for one: the mesh's handlers read the ack id and then
hand it to a MeshStationProtocol method, so what goes on the air is the station protocol's eight-byte
type-5 ack on protocol 0x14. `ack_for()` is that rule; `docs/bdsp_session.md` "Acking a mesh message"
carries the addresses.

# Version 4 uses the same message table. Its dispatcher is `MeshProtocol::vfunc9` (0x017bfc30) ->
# 0x017c0c80: `type - 1`, a 0x80 bound, and the jump table at 0x02081564. The nineteen live entries
# are the constants above minus 0x22 DUMMY_MESSAGE and 0x23 DUMMY_ACK, which fall to the default
# case.
#
# The join request is unchanged. The version-4 handler for type 1 is 0x017c1700: it reads the ack
# id as the message's last four bytes (0x017d5750, `size - 4` then a big-endian load) and compares
# byte [1] against 0xFD at 0x017c1800, the six bytes `build_join_request` sends. It answers on 0x14
# with the eight-byte ack built at 0x017c6dd0, so `ack_for` holds too.
#
# The entry stride differs: 64 bytes, not 68, with the index at 0x3E inside it rather than after a
# 64-byte location. The parser at 0x017b4830 rejects a response longer than 0x810 bytes, and 0x810
# is 0x10 + 32 * 0x40 against the 32-station bound at 0x017bfa34. The loop is
# `add x20, x20, #0x4e` (0x10 + 0x3E), then `ldrb w8, [x20], #0x40` per entry.
