"""Protocol 0x84, `nn::pia::transport::ReliableBroadcastProtocol`, the version-4 bulk channel.

`BroadcastReliableProtocol` is protocol 0x80 and uses the ACK window. Sword sends its 3456-byte
trade snapshot on 0x84 with these fields:

    11 000000 0000 ffff  00000d80 057c 0005 00000000     control, 20 bytes
    12 000000 0001 ffff  00000000 <1404 bytes>           fragment 0
    12 000000 0005 ffff  00000002 <157 bytes, deflated>  fragment 2

    0x00  u8    kind: 0x11 control, 0x12 data
    0x01  3     zero
    0x04  u16be sequence, ours, counting up across BOTH kinds on this port
    0x06  u16be the peer's sequence we have seen, 0xFFFF before any
    0x08        control: u32be total size, u16be chunk size, u16be 5, four zero bytes
                data:    u32be fragment index, then the fragment body

Pia's version-4 zlib flag 0x10 applies only to bytes after the twelve-byte prefix. Concatenating a
compressed fragment raw loses bytes from the snapshot, so `swsh.trade_payload.reassemble` refuses
an unrecognised total.

`kwsch/PokePiaSWSH` splits at the same twelve bytes and `andyjusa/nxldn-lab` builds the same eight
byte header; where they and our console differ is the CHUNK SIZE, 1244 against our console's 1404,
so that is a sender's choice and not a constant of the protocol.
