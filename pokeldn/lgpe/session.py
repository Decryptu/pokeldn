"""Everything a Let's Go session is keyed on, as far as the binary has been read.

Read off Let's Go Pikachu 1.0.2's `main`, offline. `docs/lgpe_session.md` has the address behind
each value. Three things are settled by the binary and one is not:

  * the LDN passphrase is the 64-byte literal at 0xf73a50, handed to both session settings with a
    literal length of 0x40. It is Sword's string, byte for byte.
  * the Pia game key is the sixteen ASCII bytes at 0xefd659, loaded with one `ldp` and stored into
    the crypto setting unchanged. Sword's key.
  * the Pia header version byte is 3: the initializer at 0xd122d4 stores 0x00000003_32AB9864 and the
    validator at 0xd12400 checks (byte & 0x7f) == 3. The layout is the 5.11-5.21 one that
    `pokeldn.ldn.pia4` implements for Sword's version 4; the version byte is the only difference.
  * the session-key derivation at 0x5cd560 is BDSP's and Sword's (SEAD from one 32-bit seed, four
    draws, AES-128-ECB under the game key). Which advertised value is the seed is not yet measured
    on this title; the wiki's 5.9-5.18 application-data header puts the session param at +0x0C,
    where Sword's measured seed sits.
