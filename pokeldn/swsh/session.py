"""Everything a Sword/Shield session is keyed on, as far as the binary has been read.

Read off a Shield 1.3.2 cartridge image, offline, with no hardware run - see `docs/swsh.md` for the
addresses behind each value. Two of these differ from BDSP in a way that matters:

  * the game key is a LITERAL, handed to Pia unchanged. BDSP builds its key by replacing four bytes
    of a `cryptoKeyDataSeed` with the local communication version, so a published key there is a
    derived value for one game version. Here there is nothing to derive: three call sites `ldp` the
    same sixteen ASCII bytes straight out of rodata into Pia's crypto setting.
  * the Pia protocol version byte is 4, which is NEITHER of the two bands `pokeldn.ldn` implements.
    `pia_connect.py` is 6.32+ (byte 15/16) and `pia5.py` is 5.27-5.45 (byte 9). Nothing here can
    speak to a console until a version-4 header exists, so this module deliberately stops at the
    constants and the one derivation that IS shared.

BOTH OF THE OPEN ITEMS ARE CLOSED, on hardware. The local communication id is
0x0100ABF008968000, read off a Sword's own advertisement - SWORD, so the id here is not the Shield
cartridge the binary was read from. And the value that seeds the session key is where BDSP keeps
it, twelve bytes into the application data, little-endian: 484 packets, all authenticated.
