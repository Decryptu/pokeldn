"""Sword/Shield's application layer: the protobuf messages that ride the reliable windows.

A message is a four-byte little-endian message id and a protobuf body. The ids come from two
different places in `main` and it is worth knowing which, because it decides what is measured and
what is inferred (`scratchpad/swsh_msgid.py`):

  - **the low ids are a registration table** - 838 records at 0x01BBFFA0, ids 1..880. 97, 110, 120
    and 130 are all in it.
  - **the high ids are computed, base + offset.** 40030 and its neighbours appear NOWHERE in the
    image - not as a word, not as a MOVZ immediate - while 20000, 40000 and 60000 do, and the code
    around them adds a register: `mov w9, #0x4e20; add w27, w22, w9`.

The message SHAPES are the game's own, out of the `FileDescriptorProto`s `main` ships
(`scratchpad/swsh_proto.py` reads all 78). Nothing here is a guess about a wire format:

    gflnet.p2p.sync.ping.pb.SyncPingDataHolder   1 ping, 2 pingReply, 3 pingSynced
    gflnet.p2p.block.pb.BlockDataHolder          1 result{isBlocking}, 2 imReady{isReady}
    net_contents.trade.common.pokemon_trade.protocol_buffers
        Pokemon                 1 bytes serializePokemonParam
        PokemonTradeDataHolder  1 Pokemon pokemon

Measured on this console (`scratchpad/sw_app_payloads.py`): id 97 with all three of its fields,
and id 60000 with `result{}` on 0x7C and `imReady{isReady:true}` on 0x80. Those five payloads and
no others. Everything past the trade snapshot is in `SYNC_ANSWERS` and is borrowed; see its comment.

# touching anything when the value is above 4. Its only caller is content 40's pump `0x010db3e0`,
# which passes the content's own phase `+0x17c` once that phase has caught up with the `+0x86` the
# last send recorded - so the machine leaves each idle state only when the phase advances:
#
#     phase 0 -> state 1            sends command 0, announcing phase 1
#     phase 1 -> state 3            sends command 1, announcing phase 2
#     phase 2 -> state 5 -> 6 or 8  sends command 2, announcing phase 3
#     phase 3 -> state 10 or 11 -> 12   sends command 3, announcing phase 4
#     phase 4 -> state 13           tears the holders down; nothing more is sent
#
# The ladder therefore needs all four commands, in order, and the fourth ends it.
