"""CLI_RUN_BUFFER_SCRIPT: native ARM code the console executes out of gDecompressionBuffer.

The last unopened door in the Mystery Gift client. Client_Run copies our whole 1024-byte receive
buffer into gDecompressionBuffer and then calls it every frame until it returns 1
[decomp:src/mystery_gift_client.c:237,276]:

    u32 (*func)(u32 *, struct SaveBlock2 *, struct SaveBlock1 *) = (void *)gDecompressionBuffer;
    if (func(&client->param, gSaveBlock2Ptr, gSaveBlock1Ptr) == 1)

so a payload gets r0 = &client->param, r1 = gSaveBlock2Ptr, r2 = gSaveBlock1Ptr, and whatever it
leaves in *param comes back to us through the CLI_LOAD_TOSS_RESPONSE + CLI_SEND_LOADED return
channel already proven by the Mystery Event VM [mg_script.py, docs/frlg_rom.md].

FACT: the payload is ARM, not THUMB. The console reaches it with a bx through a function pointer,
which selects the state from bit 0 of the address, and gDecompressionBuffer is word aligned.
DEDUCTION: it sits at 0x0201C000 - ld_script.ld puts ewram at 0x2000000 under ALIGN(4), reserves
gHeap 0x1C000, then links src/main.o(ewram_data) first, whose first EWRAM_DATA is
gDecompressionBuffer [src/main.c:87]. Nothing here depends on that address: every payload is
position independent, and the deduction is recorded only because a later payload may want it.

`emulate` runs a payload against a model of the GBA memory map (unicorn), which is how a payload
is proven before it is ever put on the air.

# --- call-chain: a list of calls and memory accesses, in one frame -------------------------------
# `call` makes one call. This makes up to CHAIN_MAX_STEPS, in order, in a single frame, and sends
# back one word per step. The reason is not convenience: every question about the console's game
# state is read-change-read, and twenty-four named workers are there to ask them of. A run is the
# expensive thing, not a call.
#
# The one new mechanism is PREV - a step can take its target or its first argument from the
# previous step's result - and it exists for exactly one shape:
#
#     call GetVarPointer(0x4024); write16 [prev] = 7; read16 [prev]
#
# There is no VarSet among the workers: ScrCmd_setvar writes through GetVarPointer's return
# [decomp:src/scrcmd.c:472], so setting a var the game's own way IS a call followed by an indirect
# store, and no single-call payload can do it. asm/call-chain.s has the step layout.
