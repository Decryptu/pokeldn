"""The Gen-8 Pokemon entity - the format BDSP's PB8 and Sword/Shield's PK8 BOTH are.

This is not a guess about two formats resembling each other. In PKHeX both classes are
`PKHeX.Core/PKM/Shared/G8PKM.cs` and neither overrides a single shared offset: `PB8.cs` adds one
field at 0x52 and `PK8.cs` adds one at 0x156, and that is the whole difference in the field map.
So the crypto, the block order and the ninety-odd offsets belong to neither game, and a copy of
them in each game package would be two records of one fact.

    0x00  u32  encryption constant, in the clear. It seeds both the cipher and the block order
    0x04  u16  sanity, 0 for a stored Pokemon
    0x06  u16  checksum, in the clear, over the decrypted body only
    0x08       four 80-byte blocks, encrypted and permuted   -> 0x148 = SIZE_STORED
    0x148      the party stats, encrypted and NOT permuted   -> 0x158 = SIZE_PARTY

An LCG (`seed = seed * 0x41C64E6D + 0x6073`, high half of each step) XORs every 16-bit word, and
the four blocks are then permuted by `(EC >> 13) & 31` into one of the 24 orderings of four things.

**THE PARTY STATS RESTART THE LCG.** `PokeCrypto.Decrypt8` calls `CryptArray` twice, both seeded
from the same encryption constant - the stream does not run on across 0x148. A party read
levels of 110 and 118 out of a tail that had never been decrypted at all.

**THE CHECKSUM DOES NOT CHECK THE BLOCK ORDER, AND THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN CAUGHT BY THAT TWICE.**
It is the 16-bit sum of the decrypted body, so a wrong LCG stream cannot survive it - but
permuting whole 80-byte blocks leaves a sum of 16-bit words untouched, because addition commutes.
An inverted order survives behind agreeing checksums (`bdsp/pokemon.py` tells that
one); `sw84_read.py` reintroduced the same inversion independently and called six
verifying checksums self-proving while reporting an empty slot that held a Dragonite. What catches
a wrong order is reading fields and seeing whether a Pokemon comes out.
