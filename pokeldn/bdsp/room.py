"""BDSP's OWN protocol, above Pia - the messages the Union Room is made of.

The game runs a typed protocol of its own inside the Pia payloads, and `TeamLumi/opendpr` names
every message in it: `Dpr.NetworkUtils.NetDataParser` registers 65 classes, each an `ANetData<T>`
with a `DataID` byte, and each `T` is a plain struct. Reading that beat guessing by a wide margin -
the six bytes this module first called "a fixed head" are three struct fields and a length.
`pokeldn.bdsp.netdata` is the generated table; this is what encodes and decodes.

THE FRAMING, and it fits every payload ever captured:

    0x0  1  data id
    0x1  2  payload length, BIG-endian
    0x3  .  payload - the struct, little-endian and PACKED

    01 0011 08 00 31 5a00 <x><y><z>     NetJoinData    "a player has joined, here"
    02 0048 <12 x 6 bytes>              NetPosData     where a player has been moving
    12 0001 23                          NetRequestData     "send me your data id 0x23"
    23 0001 00                          NetDataIsMatchWaitData  "I am not waiting for a match"

The layout is packed, and measured. `JoinData` is byte, byte, byte, short, Vector3: 17 bytes
packed and 20 aligned, and the console's own message is 17, with the short at offset 3. Every
payload in every capture agrees with the packed reading.

NetJoinData (id 1) is a player arriving, not a position update, so sending it repeatedly puts a
crowd of avatars in the room. A real console sends avatar 8, colour 0, casset 0x31.

NetPosData (id 2) is how a player moves, and it is cheaper: `ushort posX, ushort posZ, short rotY`
per point, several points to a message, on the unreliable stream. The game's own conversion is
`pos = (-posX * 0.05, posZ * 0.05)`, so a coordinate is a twentieth of a unit and x is negated. The
twelve points are a span, not a burst: they are where the player has been since the last message,
so a walk is one message per stride with the strides interpolated across it. Points packed tighter
than the stride make the avatar creep and then jump; `pos_span` fixes that.

A request is answered on the protocol it came in on, which is where the console puts its own
answer: all 4333 requests for 0x23 arrived on the reliable protocol and all 55 for 0x04 on the
unreliable one, with no crossover in nineteen runs.

The two messages the console repeats from the first join are a question and its own answer:
`12 0001 23` is `NetRequestData{RequestDataID = 0x23}` and 0x23 is itself a data id,
`OpcManager._RequestNetDataCallback` is an `Action<byte>`, so a request names the message it wants -
and `23 0001 00` is the console answering its own: `NetDataIsMatchWaitData{isMatchWait = 0}`, "I am
not waiting to be matched". Nothing this project has sent has ever answered a request.

    44466 and secret id 4080; 0x1e is 49, its `version`; 0x1f is 3, its `language`. Two independent
    messages agreeing on four fields.

    The ten bytes past the string's terminator carry nothing. `AllocHGlobal` does not clear its
    block and marshalling a string into a fixed field writes the characters and one terminator, so

    every declared field held still. `slack` is those bytes as hex; a record we build sends the
    console's own so ours differs from a real one only where intended.
