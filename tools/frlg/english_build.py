WHAT THIS IS. `pret/pokefirered` builds `firered_switch` and `leafgreen_switch` - REVISION 10, the
build the Switch release runs - and both come out byte-identical to the sha1 the decomp pins. It is
the ENGLISH release, so it is NOT this project's cartridges: at the same address the French console
and the English build agree on 3.7% of their bytes, because French text is a different length and
everything after a string moves. What it is instead is a second cartridge PAIR whose every symbol,
section and object is known, and the two pairs are built from the same source in the same order.

THE MEASUREMENT. A French address and an English address hold the same function whenever the content
matches, and the difference between them - the OFFSET - is piecewise constant, stepping only where a
language-dependent object changes size. Two independent readings give it, and they agree everywhere
both speak:

  1. THE TABLES, free. `gSpecials[i]`, `gScriptCmdTable[i]` and `gMysteryEventScriptCmdTable[i]` are
     the same function on both builds, so entry i on the console and entry i in the English ROM are
     an offset point. 675 of them, off dumps already on disk, no fingerprinting and no run.
  2. THE DUMPS. A 16-byte window that occurs exactly once in the English ROM places the French bytes
     that equal it. Thousands of windows per dump, and a disagreement inside one run is visible.

WHAT IT ANSWERS. Given the offset at an address, a French address becomes an English address, and
the English ELF names it - statics included, which the link map does not carry. THE CONTROL IS THE
POINT: run it against the 301 workers this project measured off the console's own bodies and it
agrees 80 times and disagrees 0 times. A name from here is a DEDUCTION with that control behind it,
never a measurement; `rom_map.CALLABLE` still means "called on hardware and something happened".

AND THE LEAFGREEN DELTA MAP. The English pair's own FireRed<->LeafGreen delta map is computable
exactly, by comparing the two ROMs: 0, -0x2c, -0x28, -0x24, -0x20, -0x1c4 - the same six values the
French cartridges measured, in the same order. Each step happens inside a version-divergent object,
not at its edge (title_screen.o, mystery_event_script.o, mystery_gift.o, pokemon.o, title_screen.o
again), and byte comparison brackets each one to a few hundred bytes. Carried across by the offset
map, that predicts where the French boundary is. A prediction, not a measurement - see --plan for
what to dump to settle it, and docs/frlg_leafgreen.md for what it is worth.

The build is not in this repository and never will be: it is a ROM. `scratchpad/legacy_linux/build_decomp.sh`
makes it from the decomp in about two minutes, and both sha1s must match the decomp's own before any
of this is worth reading.
