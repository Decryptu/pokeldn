"""Speak version-4 Pia to a Sword/Shield console, from the first packet out to a completed trade.

The console broadcasts a Local Protocol (0x24) update session ten times a second and repeats it
until every station acknowledges it, so the ack needs nothing above Pia and its pass signal is the
rebroadcast stopping. The announcement parses with `pokeldn.ldn.local_protocol`: version 1, type
0x11, 0x30 fixed bytes, eight 9-byte seats.

The header byte at 0x05 and the GCM IV's source-id byte are the same station index; `--station`
sets both and `--station-sweep` walks the readings. The console sends 0 on every packet.

Never pass --verbose to a live run; use --capture. docs/swsh_session.md, docs/pia.md.
