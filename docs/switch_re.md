# Reverse-engineering a Switch title

Reading a retail Switch game's own code on a machine too small to hold it. Worked examples:
Brilliant Diamond / Shining Pearl (Unity/IL2CPP, two NSPs totalling 7.3 GB against 3.5 GB of free
disk) and Sword / Shield (native C++, a 13.3 GB XCI on a network share).

## Order of work

1. Search the published sources for a constant you already have. The NintendoClients wiki is a
   repository; code search reaches inside it, and it carries per-game pages its summary tables do
   not link.

       gh search code "<a constant, a field name, a class name>" --limit 20
       gh api repos/kinnay/NintendoClientsWiki/contents --jq '.[].name'
       gh api repos/kinnay/NintendoClientsWiki/contents/<Page>.md --jq .content | base64 -d

   Read the per-game page, the protocol page for the right Pia version band, and the
   application-data page. A summary table gives one derived value; the pages give the rule.

2. Look for the game's own code already dumped. A decompiled C# recreation of a Unity title may be
   on GitHub (`TeamLumi/opendpr` for BDSP) and is faster to read than IL2CPP output. A game key or
   passphrase also finds third-party clients: Sword/Shield's Pia game key returns four published
   LAN-mode clients.

3. Get the executable and the metadata, matching builds. Name everything before reading anything:
   IL2CPP metadata for the C# surface, C++ RTTI for the native one.

4. Read the binary to verify, and to obtain what nobody wrote down. For BDSP: the
   `cryptoKeyDataSeed` constant and the rule that turns it into the published key.

5. Only then search a key space. A sweep with one input pinned wrong produces a confident negative
   over the wrong slice.

What a Pia LDN title needs, end to end: the LDN passphrase (to associate), the game's
`cryptoKeyDataSeed` and local communication version (which give the Pia game key), the session
parameter and network id from the advertisement, and the source MAC of each sender. The derivations
are on [The Pia layer](pia.md).

## Getting the executable out without unpacking

### From an NSP

An NSP is a PFS0 archive of NCA files. The executable is a section near the end of a multi-GB NCA.

1. Parse the PFS0 header yourself. hactool's `--listfiles` offsets are relative to the data base.
2. Decrypt the title key from the ticket. The encrypted key is at ticket `+0x180` and the rights id
   at `+0x2A0`, both absolute in the file. The rights id's last byte is the key generation;
   generation *n* uses `titlekek_{n-1}`. The rights id equals the NSP's own filename. hactool wants
   the encrypted key on `--titlekey` and does the titlekek step itself.
3. Build a sparse file. `dd` the head of the NCA, `truncate -s` it to the NCA's real size, then
   `dd ... seek_bytes conv=notrunc` only the ranges needed into place. 109 MB on disk stands in for
   2.7 GB and hactool's bounds checks are satisfied. `du -h` reports the real size; `ls -l` does not.

### From an XCI

`tools/switch/xci_read.py` walks the HFS0 partitions, decrypts each NCA header in place (AES-128-XTS
under `header_key`, big-endian sector tweak) and prints the title id, content type, key generation,
and each section's offset, counter and key:

    ./.venv/bin/python tools/switch/xci_read.py <the.xci> --keys prod.keys --type Program

A cartridge NCA's rights id is all zeroes; there is no ticket step. The body key is key area slot 2
under `key_area_key_application_<generation>`, generation `max(crypto_type, crypto_type2) - 1`. An
update's exefs is section 0 of the update Program NCA, an ordinary CTR PartitionFS (BKTR patching
touches only its RomFS), so `main` comes out with:

    ./.venv/bin/python tools/switch/xci_read.py <the.xci> --nca <id> --exefs 0 --extract main

Two struct-layout traps: the FS header's `fs_type` is at +0x2 and the hash type at +0x3 (hactool's
struct names them the other way round), and the 8-byte section counter is used reversed.

### From a RomFS

NCA sections are AES-128-CTR under the decrypted title key, with the counter formed from the
section's own CTR value and `offset >> 4` big-endian. CTR is seekable, so any range decrypts on its
own. `tools/switch/romfs_read.py` walks, greps and single-file-extracts a 4.2 GB RomFS off the
container.

The RomFS header's size field reads back as `0x50` when the counter is right; the reader raises on
any other value. A wrong key, a wrong section offset and a wrong counter all land there first.

hactool traps: a `prod.keys` with malformed lines (34 hex digits instead of 32) aborts it on the
first one; it segfaults on `--listromfs` against a sparse file whose tables are not present.

## Naming everything before reading anything

A retail Unity title carries two independent naming layers.

IL2CPP metadata names the C# surface. `global-metadata.dat` (in romfs, at `Data/Managed/Metadata`)
plus the executable is what Il2CppDumper needs; it produces a full C# class dump with the RVA of
every method. Pair the matching metadata and executable: a game update ships its own metadata.

C++ RTTI names the native surface. Itanium-ABI `type_info` records survive in the executable; a
`type_info`'s name pointer and a vtable's `type_info` pointer are ordinary relocations, so the whole
map falls out of the relocation table. `tools/switch/rtti_names.py` reports 279 `nn::pia` classes
and 2269 virtual methods for BDSP, and 252 classes and 2036 virtual methods for Sword/Shield.

The class a routine belongs to (`LocalProtocol` against `LanProtocol`) decides whether a session key
derivation is the LDN one or the LAN one; the two implementations are near-identical in shape.

`vfunc4` is `GetProtocolId` on every Pia protocol object and `vfunc9` is its receive slot, so naming
one protocol's dispatcher names every other protocol's the same way. `scratchpad/swsh_vtable.py`
prints a vtable in index order.

A vtable with holes in it is a vtable group for a class with multiple inheritance: the empty slots
are the next sub-object's offset-to-top and typeinfo.

## A constant in none of the places you would scan

A plain `[Serializable]` C# class (not a `ScriptableObject`) has its defaults written by its
constructor. A constant `byte[]` there is emitted as `RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray` against a
static field of `<PrivateImplementationDetails>`, whose bytes live in `global-metadata.dat`'s
field-default-value table. The bytes are in no executable, no asset, and none of Il2CppDumper's
tables.

The route in is the ADRP/LDR pair in the constructor: it names a metadata-usage slot, the slot
resolves to `Field$<PrivateImplementationDetails>.<HEX>`, and that hex is the SHA-1 of the initial
data. The value comes out of the metadata by field name and is verified by hashing it back. BDSP's
16-byte Pia game key seed was found this way; the loop closes any `[Serializable]` constant in any
IL2CPP title.

A native C++ title's constants are in rodata, where a cross-reference finds them.

## Check which version you dumped

A game on sale has a base release and an update in separate NSPs. The base romfs is a plain RomFS;
the update's is a BKTR patch section.

BDSP's base game defines 24 network message classes and 1.3.0 defines 65. `PosData` went from
`Vector3 pos, short rotY` to `ushort posX, ushort posZ, short rotY` (16 bytes to 6), and `JoinData`
gained two fields and lost its alignment. A layout read out of the base dump decodes a real capture
into plausible nonsense.

Checks:

- `strings global-metadata.dat | grep` for a class the newer version added and one the older
  version had. BDSP's base metadata carries `NetDataTradeStandbyData`, which the update deleted, and
  has no `NetPlayerNameData`, which the update added.
- Divide a captured length by the struct size. A 72-byte message carrying a list of points is 12 of
  6 and cannot be a whole number of 16-byte ones.

A constant does not need re-reading: BDSP's Pia key seed came out of the base metadata and decrypts
674 of 674 packets from an updated console. Anything structural that a capture has not confirmed
does.

## Reading a game update's RomFS

An update's Program NCA carries its executable in an ordinary CTR exefs and its RomFS as a BKTR
section, a patch over the base game's RomFS. Two tables at the end of the update's section, both
under the section's ordinary CTR, decide every byte of the virtual RomFS:

- the relocation table maps a virtual range to a physical one, in the update's own section or in the
  base game's RomFS section (`is_patch`);
- the subsection table gives each physical range of the update's section its own counter value,
  which replaces bytes 4..8 of the section counter.

Entries sit in 0x4000-byte buckets keyed by offset (hactool `bktr.c`). `tools/switch/bktr_read.py`
composes the two containers into one seekable section and hands it to the RomFS reader, so an
update's `global-metadata.dat` comes out of the two NSPs in place:

    ./.venv/bin/python tools/switch/bktr_read.py UPDATE.nsp --base BASE.nsp \
        --extract /Data/Managed/Metadata/global-metadata.dat

An NSP's Program NCA has a rights id, and `xci_read.py` reads its title key from the `<rights id>.tik`
in the same container: the encrypted key is at ticket `+0x180` and decrypts under
`titlekek_<keygen>`. BDSP 1.3.0's metadata is 12,496,504 bytes and carries `NetPlayerNameData`; the
base game's does not.

## Finding callers

`bl` is `100101` followed by a signed 26-bit word offset; a linear scan over the image words finds
every call site.

A tail call is `b`, opcode `000101`. A compiler emits a tail call wherever the call is the last thing
a method does, and a one-line C# forwarder (`void SendX(X d) => netData.SendReliableData(d, ...)`)
is that shape. In BDSP a BL-only scan reported zero callers for
`ANetData<SelectData>$$SendReliableData` and `ANetData<TransitionData>$$SendReliableData`; counting
both opcodes finds nine senders, every one a `b`, in the Union Room's context menus. Scan for both.

A method with no callers of either kind may be a delegate: `TradeStateModel`'s `WriteSaveData`,
`FirstSave` and `SendTradeState` have no branch to them anywhere in the image; the state machine
registers them as `Action`s, and the reference is an ADRP/ADD pair (`arm64_xref.py`).

`arm64_xref.function_start` walks back through `udf` padding, so a store can be attributed to the
function before the one that contains it; check the prologue. Bounding a function by "the first N
bytes after its entry" walks through the `ret` into the next function's body and stitches two bodies
into one call-graph edge.

Decode constants with a disassembler: `mov w0, #0x80` is encoded as an ORR-immediate on ARM64, so a
pattern sweep for a protocol id misses it.

## Calling into nnSdk

A call into nnSdk goes through a GOT slot filled by a JUMP_SLOT relocation naming the symbol.
Cross-reference the slot; count callers of its one PLT stub. `tools/switch/nso_imports.py` maps
imported symbol to GOT slot.

## The tools

All offline; none needs a console.

    tools/switch/xci_read.py     walk an XCI's HFS0 partitions (or an NSP's PFS0), decrypt every
                                 NCA header in place and print the title id, key generation and each
                                 section's offset, counter and key; --exefs N lists the exefs and
                                 --extract pulls one file out without unpacking the image
    tools/switch/nso_relocs.py   the relative relocations of an NSO, from a RELA table and from
                                 a RELR one. A modern title packs them in RELR and a reader that
                                 knows only RELA finds none, which leaves every vtable empty
    tools/switch/romfs_read.py   walk, grep and single-file-extract a RomFS in place, off the
                                 encrypted container
    tools/switch/nso_read.py     decompress an NSO's three segments (pure-Python LZ4 block decoder)
                                 and lay them at their memory offsets, so a file offset is an address
    tools/switch/nso_relocs.py   MOD0 -> dynamic -> relocations. NSO vtable slots are empty in the
                                 static image and filled at load time, so "who points at this
                                 function" is a relocation question
    tools/switch/nso_imports.py  imported symbol -> the GOT slot that holds it
    tools/switch/rtti_names.py   type_info + vtables -> class and virtual-method names
    tools/switch/arm64_xref.py   ADRP(+ADD|+LDR) cross-references, BL call graph, function starts
    tools/switch/arm64_dis.py    capstone window disassembly

`scratchpad/swsh_offset_writes.py OFF [SIZE] [LO] [HI]` lists every store to one struct offset in an
address window, with the enclosing function.
