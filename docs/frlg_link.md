# The GBA link, and what runs on it

What the console needs to hear before it will talk, and what it does once it will. Everything here
was measured on retail hardware or read out of
[pret/pokefirered](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered); each claim cites its source.

# The RFU link layer

## One child slot per parent poll

`RfuMain2_Parent` keeps exactly one child slot per poll in `gRfu.childRecvBuffer[i]` (the adapter
overwrites it) and compares its rolling `childSendCmdId` tag against the last one it kept
[link_rfu_2.c:876-892]. A tag that is not exactly `+1 mod 8` increments `numChildRecvErrors[i]`, and
`> 4` calls `RfuSetErrorParams` and kills the link. The `else` branch resets that counter to 0 on any
good tag, so death needs five consecutive bad polls.

A second slot inside one poll is a guaranteed dropped tag. Survival in the trade room scales inversely
with how far past one-per-poll the child goes:

| child emission | console kept polling for |
|---|---|
| free-running (~57/s against its ~55/s) | 0.10 s |
| 2 slots per poll | 0.28 s |
| 1 slot per poll | 5.8 s |

Nothing is exempt, including the seat walk.

## Row one of the parent's table is the console's own command, mirrored back

This rule governs every stall while the console is *sending*, in any activity.

`MGL_Send` chunks at 252 bytes and waits on `MGL_HasReceived(link->sendPlayerId)` before each chunk
and once more before it finishes [mystery_gift_link.c:176,205]. `sendPlayerId` is 1, the console's
own multiplayer id, `MysteryGiftClient_Init(sClient, 1, 0)` [mystery_gift_client.c:33]. So
`MGL_HasReceived(1)` is `gRfu.blockReceived[1]`, and on a child that is set only when the console's own
block comes back complete through row one of the parent's `gRecvCmds` table, the copy the host
mirrors. `RfuHandleReceiveCommand` runs the block reassembler over every player including the child
itself [link_rfu_2.c:1125], and `RfuMain1_Child` fills `gRecvCmds` from the parent's table, its own row
included [:970].

The console's RFU block sender waits on the same mirror: `HandleBlockSend` holds the INIT until it
sees the INIT mirrored, `SendLastBlock` repeats the last fragment until it sees that mirrored, then
re-queues every fragment missing from the mirrored bitmask [HandleSendFailure, link_rfu_2.c:1366-1416].
The console cannot name the fragment it is missing; it notices its own bitmask is short and sends
everything again.

`rfu_leader.ChildEcho` is two rules:

- Never drop a distinct command. A dropped fragment is a repair round the console runs blind.
- Coalesce a repeat that is still waiting. `SendLastBlock` re-sends the same fragment every frame
  while it waits; mirroring each repeat puts row one behind. One entry is enough. A repeat arriving
  after the mirror has gone out is a new question and is answered.

The child sends exactly one command per parent frame it receives (`childSendCount` increments only on
`recv.newDataFlag` [link_rfu_2.c:600]), so mirror in and mirror out are 1:1 and the queue cannot grow
on its own.

A two-entry bound killed one run: a 21-fragment chunk arrived partly in bursts (two commands in one
frame, four in the next) and the bound ate four of them. The console re-sent those four, the repair
for one was dropped a second time, and it declared link loss.

On any stall while the console is sending, run `scratchpad/echo_gaps.py <host capture>` first.
`never=[]` on every block, or nothing else in the capture matters.

## A tile step is exactly 16 link updates

`FacingHandler_DpadMovement` sets `objEvent->directionSequenceIndex = 16`;
`MovementStatusHandler_TryAdvanceScript` decrements it once per link update while the key is ignored
(`MOVEMENT_MODE_FROZEN`) [overworld.c:3432-3470]. One tile is 16 updates start to finish, and a run of
N direction keys leaves `N mod 16` of its last step already spent.

For a scripted walk the empty gap after a direction run only needs to cover `16 - (N mod 16)`.
Overshooting is harmless (a direction sent while frozen is ignored and the run's remaining keys retry
it) but costs a slot per update.

## The player's inputs are not always transmitted

`UpdateHeldKeyCode` rewrites EMPTY, all four DPAD codes, START and A to `LINK_KEY_CODE_NULL` whenever
`GetLinkSendQueueLength() > 1` [overworld.c:2786-2810], and `SendKeysToRfu` then sends nothing at all.
A walking player goes silent under queue pressure and looks parked.

`LINK_KEY_CODE_READY` (0x16) is not in that list, so a console that reaches its seat always transmits
its READY. Gate on 0x16, not on the absence of DPAD codes.

## The seat is a mutual barrier

`Task_EnterCableClubSeat` shows "Please wait", calls `SetInCableClubSeat()` (which makes the next
held-key emission `LINK_KEY_CODE_READY`), then spins on `GetCableClubPartnersReady()`
[cable_club.c:827-869]. That returns `CABLE_SEAT_SUCCESS` only when
`AreAllPlayersInLinkState(PLAYER_LINK_STATE_READY)` [overworld.c:2988-2999], all players. Only then
does it hand off to `Task_StartWirelessTrade`, whose `SetLinkStandbyCallback()` [cable_club.c:910-943]
is where the post-seat standby rounds come from.

Drive the post-seat rounds only once both players are READY. Driving them at a console still in
`CABLE_SEAT_WAITING` faults its seat state machine.

## What a real child sends, end to end

Recorded off a retail French FireRed acting as the child against this project's own host, full trade:

```
IDLE x8
SEND_BLOCK_INIT w1=0x0011 x4   + 17 fragments      (LinkPlayer, 0x11 = 17)
IDLE x31
SEND_BLOCK_INIT w1=0x0009 x4   + 9 fragments       (trainer card)
IDLE x262   READY_EXIT_STANDBY w1=0x0000 x1
IDLE x72    READY_EXIT_STANDBY w1=0x0001 x1
IDLE x45    <room: SEND_HELD_KEYS 0x1b x24, EMPTY, 0x1a once, the walk, READY, then EMPTY x13>
IDLE x22    READY_EXIT_STANDBY w1=0x0002 x1
IDLE x28    READY_EXIT_STANDBY w1=0x0003 x1
IDLE x75    -> the host pulls the party
```

Two properties:

- Each standby round is one frame, not a burst. Over a reliable transport (Pia Reliable here) that
  single frame is retransmitted until it lands. Repeating the count shows the host a round it has
  already completed.
- The child is fully IDLE between rounds: an all-zero `gSendCmd`, not an EMPTY held-keys keepalive.
  The leader's quiet-frame counter before the party exchange advances only on a slot that is exactly
  idle, so a keepalive there deadlocks it.

The room-load prefix (`SEND_HELD_KEYS 0x1b` = HANDLE_RECV_QUEUE ×24, then `0x1a` = IDLE once) is the
child's own queue housekeeping. `LINK_KEY_CODE_IDLE` is what sets `sPlayerLinkStates[player] = IDLE`
on the peer [overworld.c:2755], and the tile-script branch of `HandleLinkPlayerKeyInput` only runs for
a player in state IDLE.

## Both sides advance only when they have heard from the peer

`CB1_UpdateLinkState` runs `UpdateAllLinkPlayers` only when `!IsRfuRecvQueueEmpty()`, and that function
does not inspect a queue: it returns FALSE if any `gRecvCmds` entry is non-zero
[link_rfu_2.c:787-800]. Since `MoveSendCmdToRecv` copies the parent's own `gSendCmd` into
`gRecvCmds[0]` and clears it, the parent can self-sustain; in practice the loop settles into one
exchange per round trip. On a healthy link: 182 out→in alternations against 182 in→out, with only 22
in→in and 27 out→out.

The host's `SEND_HELD_KEYS` high byte is `heldKeyCount`, incremented once per prepared command, so
the last value it sends is how many link updates its trade room survived: a clock independent of wall
time and of the child's slot rate.

## Post-seat standby gate and walk-out

After both players sit, the console broadcasts its own `READY_EXIT_STANDBY` count=2 at mpId 0 about
130 ms after it reflects the host's. Its receive gate accepts a child count only when it equals its
own (`Rfu_LinkStandby` recv gate, link_rfu_2.c:1577-1591), so a count=3 sent on the reflection of the
host's count=2 is ignored. The reflection of a child slot proves the parent saw it, not that it
completed the round. Gate count=3 on the host's own mp0 count=2, and keep re-arming it, spaced by
more than the 75 idle slots the leader needs before `BufferTradeParties`.

The walk-out: the host emits `LINK_KEY_CODE_EXIT_ROOM` (0x17) and blocks in
`KeyInterCB_WaitForPlayersToExit` until `AreAllPlayersInLinkState(EXITING_ROOM)`
[overworld.c:2962-2981]. The child must answer with its own 0x17 on the held-keys stream; an all-zero
child slot is not a key and the host waits forever.

## One-sided cancel returns both sides to the menu

`PLAYER_CANCEL_TRADE` / `PARTNER_CANCEL_TRADE` go through `CB_HandleTradeCanceled` → `CB_MAIN_MENU`
[trade.c:2094-2113]; only `BOTH_CANCEL_TRADE` ends the session [1715-1722]. The joiner re-enters
S4_PARTY and selects again after 60 frames. Answering every `REQUEST_CANCEL` at SELECT with
`PARTNER_CANCEL_TRADE` loops the console on "votre ami veut échanger des Pokémon"; a second
consecutive CANCEL now makes the leader cancel too, giving `BOTH_CANCEL_TRADE` and the exit path.

## Version and language are not gates

`IsTryingToTradeAcrossVersionTooSoon` [union_room.c:1499] fires only when the partner is neither
FireRed nor LeafGreen, and it prints an in-game message rather than dropping the link. Cross-version
FR↔LG trading is confirmed working on hardware. The only language branch on the link path is
`ConvertInternationalString`, which special-cases Japanese and nothing else; a French FireRed accepts
an English Wonder Card.

## The emulator can close the link on its own

This is not game logic. `HandleLinkConnection` runs `svc_51` on the Switch build only [link.c:1654]:

    #if REVISION >= 0xA
        if (svc_51())
        {
            ...
            CloseLink();
        }
    #endif

`svc_51` is a bare `swi 0x51` whose return value comes from the emulator [sloopsvc.c:120]. When it
returns non-zero the ROM calls `CloseLink()` and then, if `Task_MysteryGift` is active,
`RfuSoftReset()`, otherwise `RfuReloadSave()` [link.c:1674]. That soft reset is the Switch error
2318-0006 the player sees. A run that dies with the host clean at the RFU level is evidence about the
LDN/Pia layer, not the game protocol; game-level frame counts cannot move it.

The rest of the emulator's RFU surface:

| SVC | called from | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `swi 0x45` | librfu_rfu.c:667,749 | hands the emulator `gRfuLinkStatus` |
| `swi 0x49` | AgbRfu_LinkManager.c:657 | while non-zero, holds `connect_period` open during SEARCH_CHILD |
| `swi 0x4a` | AgbRfu_LinkManager.c:720 | the same, during SEARCH_PARENT |
| `swi 0x4b` | link_rfu_2.c:2114, union_room_player_avatar.c:518 | `SVC4B_EXIT_EARLY` bails out of SpawnGroupLeader; `SVC4B_RESEED_RNG` reseeds from the host's trainer id |
| `swi 0x51` | link.c:1654 | close the link now (soft reset under Mystery Gift) |
| `swi 0x53` | wireless_communication_status_screen.c:328 | emulator-driven exit from the status screen |

# The wireless layer, as this game exercises it

## The advertised rate set

`host_pia` unicasts the Pia type 5 Update Session to each joined station because the console receives
about one in five broadcast data frames. The host advertises the Switch rate set (1B 2B 5.5B 11B 6 9
12 18 with extended rates 24 36 48 54). The rate set alone is sufficient; the Switch's other beacon
and association elements (DTIM 2, ERP, capability 0x411, the Nintendo vendor element, HT/HE, WMM)
are not needed.

The console builds its association request's rate set from the beacon, not the probe response. The
beacon head carries elements 0 (SSID), 1 (Supported Rates) and 3 (DS Params) so the association
request includes rates 6, 9 and 12.

The working beacon uses a 41-byte subset. A full 208-byte element set stalls Mystery Gift traffic.

The console's wlan/LDN layer uses the advertised rate set. Which of 6, 9 and 12 is required is
unknown.

Counted over every run log on disk, the failure signature disappeared: 78 occurrences in 215
associations before the fix window, and 0 in the 232 since. 26 of those clean associations ran on the
*old* beacon, so the beacon change is not what stopped it, and which change did is unsettled.

Two unrelated faults with the same signature: WMM (the console switches to QoS data frames once the
AP advertises it, and a vendored decoder rejected subtype 8), and a probe response that dropped its
RSN element while the capability word advertised privacy.

## The console as a Pia child

Measured with the receive client (`bin/frlg_mg_client.py`) against a real Mystery Gift host, and
against this project's host with the type 2 disabled:

- The console child does not finalize on a type 5 Update Session alone. It re-sends its join request
  every 0.5 s, ignores unicast type 5 copies, and leaves 3.05-3.20 s after its join. The type 2 Join
  Response is required.
- A real Mystery Gift host sends a real console child its type 5 within ~50-66 ms of its Net 0x11. To
  this project's client it sent no type 2 and held the type 5 for 2.03 s, sending only RTT probes every
  316 ms meanwhile; the difference in the join request is not identified.
- A real trade host sends type 5 and type 2 within 34 ms and originates RTT only after finalization.
- The adapter, as the console's station, stayed associated for a full 31 s; the console never used
  `svc_51` against it as a child.

Timeline of a real Mystery Gift host, from its Net 0x11 (`scratchpad/pia_msgs.py`):

    0.000  Net 0x11 (once)
    0.006  us: Net 0x12 + Session join
    0.252  RTT request, then every 316ms (6 probes, nothing else)
    2.038  Session type 5, no type 2 ever
    2.040  us: type 6 (finalize); 2.159 reliable open
    2.318  host 'A' frame
    4.63   host's own NI (join status = the user's YES on the console)
    6.82   SEND_PLAYER_IDS, 6.87 BLOCK_REQ (2.2s after the YES)
    8.15   Net 0x50 property update every ~0.5s, acked 0x51

## 802.11 behaviour

- Console as station: no power save (PM bit 0 on every frame), RTS before every data frame, and a
  clean mid-stream deauth with no probe or null frames before it.
- rtw88 (kernel 7.0) sends management frames at the lowest BSS basic rate and beacons at 1M
  unconditionally; injected action frames have no vif and go at 1M. A Switch host beacons at 11M and
  sends data at 48-54M.
- The monitor vif's copy of the host's own frames carries mac80211's intended rate (software
  loopback), so air captures cannot measure the host's transmit rate. That loopback is emitted at TX
  status (the rtw88 USB URB completion) and lags `sendto` by a median 594 ms, quantised at ~610 ms
  multiples, while the console acknowledges the same frame within 15 ms. Use the host's own frames'
  air timestamps for ordering only.
- The Switch host drops about 40% of a child's Pia datagrams inside its own stack after MAC-acking
  them, independent of spacing, timing, size or content. Pia delivers in order, so each drop stalls the
  child's stream for a retransmission timeout; repeating every reliable data frame in the next few
  datagrams removes the stalls, and the host de-duplicates by sequence.

## The Pia header nonce is a counter the console enforces

The console keeps, per channel, the last accepted 8-byte header nonce (big-endian) and drops any
datagram whose nonce is not strictly above it. A random nonce passes that test about half the time:

    random nonce:   ~1.1 duplicate outgoing reliable deliveries per unique frame, ~0.3 inbound
    counter nonce:  0.34 outgoing, 0.00 inbound

The inbound duplicates were the console retransmitting because its acks were being dropped too.
`Sim._next_nonce` counts; the host already did.

## Carry-forward

With the counter nonce the remaining duplicates are the carry-forward: each reliable frame repeated in
the next 4 datagrams, acknowledged about 17 ms after the original. It earns its place because air loss
is 1-2% and bursty, Pia delivers in order, and a hole holds every later slot back until the console's
8-deep RFU receive queue overflows. With carry 0 on the host, one lost parent slot and its 68 ms
retransmit put ten slots into the console at once and it disconnected 300 ms later.

The console's own child-side retransmit rate is 0.01-0.02 per frame in every host capture, which is
the real air loss. `scratchpad/host_rtx.py` measures a host capture; `rtx_analyze.py` / `rtx_where.py`
a joiner one.

## The console's acknowledgement lag is a 512 ms metronome

`scratchpad/acklag.py` reconstructs, per datagram, the highest sequence sent against the console's
cumulative ack, which lives in the CTRL frame's payload via `parse_bulk_ack`, not in the reliable
header's `ack` field (that one is the sender's own lowest pending sequence).

The console stalls for 50-70 ms at a time. It is not silent by choice and not slow: inbound stops for
one gap of 35-70 ms against a 15 ms baseline, during which it sends only a retransmit of its own last
frames (its retransmission timer firing because its ack was not processed), and then it advances its
cumulative ack several frames in a single jump:

    26.553 in   D1849 D1850 ACK next=919
    26.587 OUT  D919 D920 ACK next=1851
    26.617 in   D1849* D1850*        (retransmits, no ack)
    26.653 in   ACK next=924         (catches up five frames at once)

Every period is an integer number of 512 ms slots. Across 42 intervals in five runs (two cartridges,
three activities) every measured period lands on a 512 ms grid with a maximum error of
16 ms, which is one 60 Hz frame and so the sampling resolution. Slot counts observed are 16 and 17
(8.192 s and 8.704 s), with one 18 and one 33 where a tick was skipped. The grid is phase-locked to
the console's LDN join and does not drift: twelve stalls over 103 s span 18 ms of phase.

The stall is the same size everywhere; what differs is what it lands on. On an idle chat link the
outstanding count reaches 5 and nothing happens; under Mystery Gift or trade load the same 50-70 ms
lands on a full send window.

What the 512 ms grid is remains unknown. It is console-internal and joins-relative, so it is a timer
the emulator or the Pia/LDN layer starts at session establishment rather than a game-side one: the
ROM has no 512 ms tick and the stalls are indifferent to what the game is doing. No hardware run is
needed to study it: every capture already taken carries the signal.

## The ident-25 stall: a hole plus an unbounded backlog

The console sometimes goes idle after the last delivery-script block (ident 25,
`MG_LINKID_RAM_SCRIPT`), never sends ident 20 (READY_END), and leaves. A parent block is never
reflected by the child, so the lost fragment is invisible in the capture.

One run caught the mechanism. Two consecutive frames were lost at 18.78 s. The console's cumulative
ack stayed put for 1.75 s and it sent no bulk ack at all in that time, while its own data kept flowing
at 45-62 datagrams/s. The host re-sent the two frames in every datagram (about 100 copies) and kept
emitting new frames behind them, five per datagram with carry-forward. When the console finally
acknowledged at 20.53 s it held only those two plus a block ten frames later; the mask then filled at
30-80 frames per 50 ms, and at 21.00 s the hole closed and the console released 97 frames to the
game in one datagram. Its RFU receive queue is 8 deep: the ident-25 fragments in that release were
dropped, the block never completed, and the console sat on "Transmission..." for 150 s with no timeout.

The console accepted nothing for 1.75 s although every datagram carried the frame it was waiting for.
With the backlog behind the hole it had no room to take the retransmit either, so the hole is
self-sustaining as long as new frames keep arriving. The normal ack lag is 0-1 frames at 99% of acks.

Fix: `HostSession` holds new frames while the console has not cumulatively acknowledged
`HOST_OUTSTANDING_MAX` (6) frames, keeps retransmitting the gap, and resumes when the ack catches up. A
closed hole then releases at most 6 frames. Tools: `scratchpad/ack_trace.py`, and the frames-per-datagram
count over `host_decode.py` output.

Separately, sending the ident-25 block three times (`--ram-script-block-repeat 3`) took a stalling
console to 5/5. Whether the cause is air loss or the console's post-Pia RFU-to-game handoff dropping a
fragment is not established; the redundancy covers both. `--block-repeat 1` is measurably worse.

## Transmission-phase deaths after the card

Every death after the card showed the host's UDP output peaking at 52-519 datagrams per 0.25 s where
every successful delivery peaked at 23-36. The mechanism is a 250 ms-3 s adapter transmit stall (frames
sat in the rtw88 USB path; the host process never paused), then no acks, then every unacked frame due
and re-sent every tick, producing a flood the console never recovers from. Four host fixes, all on by
default:

- `HOST_RTX_LIMIT` caps Reliable retransmits per VBlank.
- `FRLG_ECHO_MAX` bounds the FIFO echo of the child's block slots.
- The transmit socket is non-blocking and `FRLG_QUIET_GATE_MS` holds retransmits and carry-forward
  while the console is silent: it pauses about 0.5 s after accepting the card (its flash save), and a
  blocking send during that pause froze the host for 6-11 s.
- A duplicate child message no longer crashes the host receiver.

The adapter stall itself is unexplained. rtw88's USB path queues without back-pressure; USB
passthrough under virtualization is a candidate.

## Datagrams held between the socket and the air

A battle run can end with the console showing "erreur de connexion, rapprochez-vous", and it begins
with the host's datagrams being held 0.1-1.1 s below the UDP socket. The console's Pia window freezes,
it keeps retransmitting its own frames and every one is received; the host keeps emitting ~90
datagrams/s with monotonic Pia header nonces and no `EAGAIN`; the air capture shows the host's frames
absent for the blackout and released as one burst (71 frames in 200 ms in one case). The console's
power-management bit is never set. It is not the party data: one failure used the party four completed
runs had used. By the time frames resumed the game had already taken the link-loss path
[link_rfu_2.c:2312 → CB2_PrintErrorMessage, link.c:1521]; one console resumed receiving for 70 ms and
disconnected anyway.

Where to look, and where not to. The host's UDP socket is `SO_BINDTODEVICE`'d to `ldn-tap`, and the
vendored LDN library reads that tap *in Python* and injects the 802.11 frame with AF_PACKET on
`ldn-mon` (`ldn/__init__.py:1795-1858`, `wlan.py:1115-1144`), so these datagrams never enter the AP
vif's transmit path at all. Measured with kprobes: `ieee80211_subif_start_xmit` fired 0 times while
`tun_net_xmit` fired 17549 and `ieee80211_monitor_start_xmit` 24705. Every station-txq observation
(empty queue, frozen dequeue counters, aqm backlog 0, AQL, block-ack, the qdisc) sits downstream of a
userspace hop. mac80211's power-save buffer is ruled out directly:
`ieee80211_tx_h_unicast_ps_buf` returned TX_QUEUED zero times in two instrumented runs.

The console-side re-send mechanics seen alongside it are the decomp's and not a fault: the child
re-enqueues every fragment missing from its own echo bitmask (`HandleSendFailure`, link_rfu_2.c:1015)
and the receiver ORs fragments into a bitmask, so duplicated or reordered echoes are harmless.

Which of the three stages holds the frame is unknown. It has not reproduced across eight clean runs,
including a 23-minute 51-second link battle with the trap armed throughout: no hold of 150 ms or more,
`g_py` never left 0, `ps_buf` never returned TX_QUEUED, and `echo_gaps` found a fragment the host failed
to mirror in 0 of 494 blocks. A run is a trap set rather than a search:
`scratchpad/legacy_linux/txpath_trace.bt` partitions the path into g_tap (the tap ring), g_py (inside Python) and
g_mon (mac80211/rtw88), and `scratchpad/txpath.py` names the growing gauge at a hold.

The measurements above are the Linux card's. On the ESP32 board a FireRed trade's longest wait
between the socket and the peer's acknowledgement over four trades was 265 ms, all of it in the board's transmit
queue behind one unacknowledged frame, and every trade completed
([ESP32 radio](hardware_esp32.md), TX_DONE).

That long run also retired a generalisation: the acknowledgement-lag *size* does grow with run length
(the worst inbound gap went 44 ms to 90 ms, with the three worst gaps in the last eight seconds), two
orders of magnitude below what a hold means.

# The Union Room

Every activity the room offers works: greetings, a trading-board trade, chat both ways, and full link
battles.

## Getting listed: the advertised activity byte

A console searching for a partner keeps a candidate only if its advertised activity appears in the
accept list of the link group it is searching in [`IsPartnerActivityAcceptable`, union_room.c:1590;
`sAcceptedActivityIds`, src/data/union_room.h:398-456]. Most of those lists hold exactly one id.

A console standing in the Union Room advertises `ACTIVITY_SEARCH` (12) and searches with
`LINK_GROUP_UNION_ROOM_INIT`, whose list is `{ACTIVITY_SEARCH, 0xFF}` [src/data/union_room.h:419]. A
trade host advertises `ACTIVITY_TRADE` (4) and a Mystery Gift host `ACTIVITY_WONDER_CARD` (21), so both
are rejected before the group list is drawn. That is why the middle NPC on Pokemon Center 2F could not
see either of them. It is a filter on the advertised activity alone, not a different transport,
discovery service or Pia-level difference.

Once players are inside the room the search switches to `LINK_GROUP_UNION_ROOM_RESUME`
[union_room.c:2664], whose list is `IN_UNION_ROOM | activity` with `IN_UNION_ROOM = 1 << 6`
[include/constants/union_room.h:49].

The activity byte alone decides which menu lists a host. Changing that one byte in the record at
offset 16 from 21 to 22 moved a host from the console's Wonder Cards screen to its Wonder News screen,
with nothing else in the advertisement changed (same Pia header, same record, same trainer id, same
name), and the console listed it, joined, and completed a gift session.

## The connect: IN_UNION_ROOM, exactly and alone

`IsPartnerActivityIncompatible` [src/link_rfu_2.c:2925] tests

    else if (partner->activity != IN_UNION_ROOM)   // [link_rfu_2.c:2933]
        return TRUE;

as an exact equality, so any activity bits beside IN_UNION_ROOM fail it. Advertising
`IN_UNION_ROOM | ACTIVITY_TRADE` (0x44) spawns the avatar, and talking to it prints "Communication avec
PkCamp" then "le DRESSEUR est occupé" with not one packet from the console on the air: the connect is
refused inside `Task_TryConnectToUnionRoomParent` [link_rfu_2.c:2963] before the RFU layer transmits.
The trade intent is carried in `sPlayerCurrActivity` and negotiated after the link is up, never
advertised.

Advertising the bare `IN_UNION_ROOM` (0x40) connects. The avatar tracks the beacon live: it walked out
and back in when the host was restarted mid-session, so the room's player list is not a snapshot taken
at entry.

## No parent NI, and the five-frame rule

The Union Room child expects no parent join-status NI at all.

`rfu_LMAN_CHILD_checkSendChildName2` [AgbRfu_LinkManager.c:1203] raises
`LMAN_MSG_CHILD_NAME_SEND_COMPLETED` as soon as its own name NI reaches `SLOT_STATE_SEND_SUCCESS`;
`LinkManagerCB_UnionRoom` [link_rfu_2.c:2526] answers by setting `RFUSTATE_UR_PLAYER_EXCHANGE` and a
TYPE_UNI receive buffer, never a TYPE_NI one; `Task_UnionRoomListen` [link_rfu_2.c:533] then calls
`rfu_UNI_setSendData` and starts `Task_PlayerExchange` as MODE_CHILD. The trade-centre callback
[link_rfu_2.c:2364] is the one that adds the TYPE_NI buffer for a join status.

Sending an NI body is actively harmful. `rfu_STC_NI_receive` accepts LCOM_NI_START into control
data without a game buffer [librfu_rfu.c:2202], and only the LCOM_NI body needs one; the child's
`rfu_STC_NI_initSlot_asRecvDataEntity` fails with ERR_RECV_BUFF_OVER [librfu_rfu.c:2300], which sets
`recvErrorFlag`, which turns `rfu_REQ_recvData` into a REQ error, which `LinkManagerCB_UnionRoom`
handles as `LMAN_MSG_REQ_API_ERROR` → `RfuSetErrorParams` → "erreur de connexion, rapprochez-vous"
[link_rfu_2.c:2585]. `RFULeader(skip_parent_ni=True)`, enabled by `--union-room`, is the fix.

The console's disconnect follows exactly five parent frames it left unanswered, whatever those
frames were. Three runs, re-timed against each other:

    child NULL 28.361  we send NI ts=8..12, K only   D 28.496   (NI_STARTs ts=6,7 were mirrored)
    child NULL 34.069  we send NI ts=8..12, K only   D 34.199
    child NULL 36.527  we send UNI ts=6..10, K only  D 36.628

Measured from the child's NULL the delay is 135/130/101 ms; the third is two frames earlier on both
clocks, and two frames is exactly the pair of NI_START mirrors it did not have. Counting unanswered
frames fits all three with no residual, and it matches `maxMFrame = 4` in `sRfuReqConfigTemplate`
[link_rfu_2.c:128]. A healthy trade-centre run never exceeds two silent frames.

The keepalive is what carries the connect through. `--union-room-keepalive N` re-presents the first
parent NI_START for N VBlanks before UNI. The console mirrors each one, so it always has an
acknowledgement subframe to send and the five-frame rule never fires. With 120, the console mirrored
every re-presented NI_START, then answered the first UNI `SEND_PLAYER_IDS` with UNI frames of its own,
sent its LinkPlayer block, took the host's, exchanged trainer cards, and showed its prompt.

The console then waits about eight seconds, which is not a defect. It reaches
`RFUSTATE_UR_PLAYER_EXCHANGE` promptly and sits in `Task_UnionRoomListen` retrying `rfu_UNI_setSendData`
every frame; that call fails with ERR_SUBFRAME_SIZE while a NI_START is pending on its receive slot,
because the receive control takes 2 of the child's 16 LL-frame bytes [librfu_rfu.c:2262] and the child's
UNI subframe needs all 16 [librfu_rfu.c:1449]. The pending receive is released only by the link
manager's `NI_failCounter_limit`, 480 frames after the last NI_START [link_rfu_2.c:139,
AgbRfu_LinkManager.c:1328]. In one run the console's first UNI frame came on the very frame after its
last NI_START ack, 482 frames after the host's last. There is no way to release it early: an NI body is
the error path above.

## What the console does once connected

[src/union_room.c:2858-2879]

    if (gReceivedRemoteLinkPlayers) {
        CreateTrainerCardInBuffer(gBlockSendBuffer, TRUE);
        CreateTask(Task_ExchangeCards, 5);
        uroom->state = UR_STATE_COMMUNICATING_WAIT_FOR_DATA;
    }
    ... then, if sPlayerCurrActivity == (ACTIVITY_TRADE | IN_UNION_ROOM),
        UR_STATE_SEND_TRADE_REQUST

So the Union Room is the ordinary link plus a trainer card block exchange in front of an activity
request.

The prompt reads "PkCamp: oh bonjour \<name>, vous désirez quelque chose ?" with Salut / Combat /
Tchat / Retour. Each choice sends one `SEND_PACKET` and waits on an answer
[UR_STATE_HANDLE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST, union_room.c:3151]:

| the console sends | activity | the host answers |
|---|---|---|
| 0x48 | CARD (Salut) | 0x51 ACCEPT |
| 0x44 | TRADE (trading board) | 0x51 ACCEPT |
| 0x41 | BATTLE (Combat) | 0x51 ACCEPT |
| 0x45 | CHAT (Tchat) | 0x51 ACCEPT |
| 0x40 | EXIT (Retour) | treat as the console's close |

After each activity both sides `SetLinkStandbyCallback` [union_room.c:2995, :3012] and the console
returns to its prompt, so a session can run several in a row.

On the Switch build the accepting side also gates on `svc_CommsAllowedByParentalControls()`
[union_room.c:3159, :3037, REVISION >= 0xA]. The console is the requester, so its own parental-control
setting can turn its request into a DECLINE before the host sees it, so a silent refusal at the prompt
is that, not a protocol fault.

Salut shows the host's trainer card and can be repeated; Retour sends 0x40 then READY_CLOSE_LINK, and
once answered with a matching READY_CLOSE_LINK the console sends its normal disconnect, leaves LDN, and
the player is back in the room with no error.

## The trading board

The console's board lists partners whose advertisement carries `tradeSpecies`, `tradeType` and
`tradeLevel` [union_room.c:3400]. Record bytes 18 (`type << 2`), 19 (`gender | level << 1`) and 22:24
(little-endian `tradeSpecies:10` of `RfuGameData` [include/link_rfu.h:107]) are all proven: registering
species 277 (Treecko), whose low byte alone is 21 (Spearow), listed "PkCamp / NORMAL / ARCKO / 26", so
byte 23 is measured rather than inferred.

A board trade runs `Task_StartUnionRoomTrade` exactly as written: the console's Pokemon block (count
9), the host's back, its mail block (count 19), the host's back, the animation, its READY_FINISH, the
host's CONFIRM_FINISH, the save barriers, its READY_CLOSE_LINK, the host's, its normal disconnect.
Board pick to back in the room is about 45 s, of which ~10 s is the keepalive wait and ~32 s the
animation.

The Union Room trade needs no party exchange, no menu and no room-entry route: it is the shortest
trade the host performs.

## Chat

Chat rides the ordinary `SendBlock` path, not `Rfu_SendPacket`. Every member calls
`SendBlock(0, sendMessageBuffer, 0x28)` unsolicited, with no `BLOCK_REQ` first
[`ChatEntryRoutine_Join`, union_room_chat.c:429; `ChatEntryRoutine_SendMessage`, :823]. A 0x28-byte
block is `count` 4, the same as the trade path's giftRibbons block.

The block layout [`PrepareSendBuffer_*`, union_room_chat.c:1256-1281; `ProcessReceivedChatMessage`,
:1283]:

    [0]      command: 0 NULL, 1 CHAT, 2 JOIN, 3 LEAVE, 4 DROP, 5 DISBAND
    [1..8]   player name, PLAYER_NAME_LENGTH + 1 bytes, EOS-terminated
    [9]      multiplayer id            (JOIN / LEAVE / DROP / DISBAND)
    [9..39]  message text, EOS-terminated (CHAT)

Entry is the same shape as the room trade: the console asks with 0x45, and on ACCEPT it prints the
start message, runs `SetLinkStandbyCallback`, fades, and enters `Task_StartActivity`'s chat branch
[union_room.c:1938]. As the child it calls `LinkRfu_StopManagerBeforeEnteringChat`
(`rfu_LMAN_stopManager(FALSE)`, which only stops accepting *new* connections), then
`SetHostRfuGameData(ACTIVITY_CHAT | IN_UNION_ROOM, 0, TRUE)` and `EnterUnionRoomChat`. The existing link
is untouched, so the host has nothing to rebuild.

Both members send JOIN on entry, independently and with no wait for a peer, so reacting to the
console's JOIN is safe and avoids racing its fade.

A line is 15 entries, not 30 bytes. `MESSAGE_BUFFER_NCHAR` is 15 [union_room_chat.c:21] and the
keyboard's append loop stops there [:1112], so the console itself can never type a 16th entry. Its
buffer is `2 * MESSAGE_BUFFER_NCHAR + 1` = 31 bytes only because one entry may be a
`CHAR_EXTRA_SYMBOL` (0xF9) pair, which `StringLength_Multibyte` counts as one [string_util.c:560]; this
project's charmap emits no 0xF9, so 31 bytes of field is 15 sendable characters.

Nothing on the receive path re-checks that. `ProcessReceivedChatMessage` does a bare `StringCopy` of
whatever arrives [:1308] and `PrintTextOnWin0Colorized` draws it as one unwrapped line into a 168 px
row that the name and an `EXT_CTRL_CODE_CLEAR_TO 42` push to x=42. There is no clip and no wrap: entry
16 onward is drawn past the right edge. `uroom_chat.MESSAGE_NCHAR` is 15, counted multibyte-aware by
`uroom_chat.entry_count`, and an over-long `--chat-message` or `--chat-file` line is refused at
start-up.

The leader must actively close on a LEAVE. The leaver parks on `!gReceivedRemoteLinkPlayers`
waiting for the parent to drop the link before it saves and walks back into the room
[`ChatEntryRoutine_AskQuitChatting` cases 2/4/5, union_room_chat.c:596-660]. Marking the activity done
and stopping left the console on its "quit the chat?" prompt with the network icon spinning for 70 s.
With the host's DROP going out 0.1 s after the console's LEAVE and the close-link handshake run, the
console answers with its own READY_CLOSE_LINK and its normal disconnect. The bounded chat-exit grace
remains as the fallback for a silent leaver.

Chat is genuinely interactive: lines appended to `--chat-file` while the host is running reach the
console, and a reply lands about 1.7 s after the file is written. Round-trip latency is dominated by
the console's on-screen keyboard.

## The link battle (UR_BATTLE 0x41)

The entry gate is on the console's party, not on the host's. `HasAtLeastTwoMonsOfLevel30OrLower`
[union_room.c:4565] counts party mons with `MON_DATA_LEVEL <= 30` that are not eggs and requires two. It
gates the activity twice (when the console offers a battle [union_room.c:2923] and when it accepts one
[union_room.c:3176, which sends DECLINE instead]), and both tests read `gPlayerParty`, so each side
tests only itself. The refusal is a message on the console's screen.

The pre-battle exchange [union_room_battle.c, `CB2_UnionRoomBattle`]: after both sides pick two
mons, each sends one 0x20-byte block whose first byte is `ACTIVITY_ACCEPT | 0x40` = 0x51, or 0x52 if the
selection was cancelled; the rest is zero. Both blocks must read 0x51 or the console closes the link and
prints "refused". Then, on the Switch path only, there are two link-task waits with a standby
between them where the GBA release had one (`#if REVISION >= 0xA` cases 50/51/52).

`SetUpPartiesAndStartBattle` keeps only the two chosen mons, zeroes the other four, and calls
`StartUnionRoomBattle(BATTLE_TYPE_LINK | BATTLE_TYPE_TRAINER)` [union_room.c:1811], which sets
`gLinkPlayers[0].linkType = LINKTYPE_BATTLE` (0x2211) [link.h:92]. `TryReceiveLinkBattleData` tests that
value exactly [battle_controllers.c:520], so the link type is load-bearing.

Then [`CB2_HandleStartBattle`, battle_main.c:934]:

    state 1  SendBlock struct LinkBattlerHeader {versionSignatureLo, versionSignatureHi,
             vsScreenHealthFlagsLo, vsScreenHealthFlagsHi, struct BattleEnigmaBerry}
    state 3  SendBlock gPlayerParty[0..1]   200 bytes      state 4  recv -> gEnemyParty
    state 7  SendBlock gPlayerParty[2..3]   200 bytes      state 8  recv
    state 11 SendBlock gPlayerParty[4..5]   200 bytes      state 12 recv
    state 15 InitBattleControllers

The party exchange is byte for byte the 3 × 200-byte transfer trades already use (`mon.party_blocks`);
`Rfu_InitBlockSend` asserts size <= 252, so 200 is legal.

### Master election

In a link single battle only the side with `BATTLE_TYPE_IS_MASTER` sets
`gBattleMainFunc = BeginBattleIntro`; the other side's stays `BeginBattleIntroDummy`
[`InitLinkBtlControllers`, battle_controllers.c:141; `SetUpBattleVars`, :45].

The non-master runs no battle logic: no turn resolution, no damage calculation, no RNG. It receives
BUFFER_A controller commands over the link, runs them for display, and answers. Implementing
the host as the non-master is writing a battle *controller*, not a battle *engine*.

`LinkBattleComputeBattleTypeFlags` [battle_main.c:886], from the console's seat at multiplayer id 1
(the host is the parent, id 0): if `gBlockRecvBuffer[0][0] == 0x100`, player 0 is master; else if both
signatures are equal, player 0 is master; else "lowest index player with the highest game version". So
sending a version signature below 0x201 and not equal to 0x100 makes the console elect itself
master. The host sends 0x200.

### The link buffer protocol

Every controller command travels as one SendBlock with an 8-byte header
[battle_controllers.c:401-435]: `LINK_BUFF_BUFFER_ID, ACTIVE_BATTLER, ATTACKER, TARGET, SIZE_LO,
SIZE_HI, ABSENT_BATTLER_FLAGS, EFFECT_BATTLER`, then the payload, whose stored size is rounded up as
`alignedSize = size - size % 4 + 4` (always at least +1 word, so a 4-byte payload is stored as 8).
`bufferId` is 0 = BUFFER_A (a command), 1 = BUFFER_B (a reply), 2 = an exec-flag clear whose one
payload byte is the sender's multiplayer id [Task_HandleCopyReceivedLinkBuffersData:566-594].

Battler numbering agrees on both sides (battler 0 is the master's mon, battler 1 the non-master's)
because the master maps 0=Player/1=LinkOpponent and the non-master maps 1=Player/0=LinkOpponent. The
host's mon is battler 1.

The sync rule [battle_util.c:185-201]: `MarkBattlerForControllerExec` sets bit `28+battler`; when the
command's own block arrives back, `MarkBattlerReceivedLinkData` sets `gBitTable[battler] << (i*4)` for
every linked player i and clears bit 28+battler; each player clears its own nibble by sending bufferId
2 with its multiplayer id. The master advances only on `gBattleControllerExecFlags == 0`.

So every command the console emits must be acknowledged, for both battlers, or the master stalls
forever. That single rule is most of the work.

Of the 56 player-buffer commands [battle_controller_player.c:110] all but these are display-only and
need nothing but the acknowledgement:

    CONTROLLER_GETMONDATA    -> EmitDataTransfer(BUFFER_B, size, data)   [player.c:1515]
    CONTROLLER_CHOOSEACTION  -> EmitTwoReturnValues(1, B_ACTION_*, 0)    [player.c:232-241]
    CONTROLLER_CHOOSEMOVE    -> EmitTwoReturnValues(1, 10, move | target << 8) [player.c:342]
    CONTROLLER_CHOOSEPOKEMON -> EmitChosenMonReturnValue(1, partyId, order)    [player.c:1316]
    CONTROLLER_OPENBAG       -> EmitOneReturnValue(1, itemId)            [player.c:1340]
    CONTROLLER_EXPUPDATE     -> EmitTwoReturnValues(1, RET_VALUE_LEVELED_UP, exp) [player.c:1051]
    CONTROLLER_ENDLINKBATTLE -> gBattleOutcome = payload[1], then ack     [player.c:2876]

`B_ACTION_USE_MOVE` 0, `USE_ITEM` 1, `SWITCH` 2, `RUN` 3 [battle.h:34].

The first command of every battle is `GETMONDATA` with `REQUEST_ALL_BATTLE`, emitted to each battler in
turn [battle_main.c:2519]. The reply is a whole `struct BattlePokemon` [pokemon.h:170, 0x58 bytes] built
field by field in `CopyPlayerMonData` [player.c:1519]. Every field it fills (species, the five stats,
moves, PP, the six IVs, level, hp/maxHP, item, nickname, otName, experience, personality, status1,
friendship, ppBonuses, abilityNum, otId) the host already computes or carries
(`pokeldn/frlg/save/stats.py`, `pokeldn/frlg/save/mon.py`). It does *not* fill `statStages`, `ability`,
`type1`, `type2`, `status2` or `unknown`; those go out as stack garbage and the receiver recomputes
them, so zeros are fine.

BUFFER_B replies for battler 0 may be skipped. The console answers its own GETMONDATA locally from
`gEnemyParty` through its LinkOpponent controller [link_opponent.c:444] and its reply loops back to it,
so another would be a duplicate.

Forfeiting is a complete first milestone. The "you can't run from a trainer" branch explicitly
excludes link battles [battle_main.c:3239] and a link battler choosing RUN is given top turn order
[:3548-3560], so answering the first `CHOOSEACTION` with `B_ACTION_RUN` exercises the whole path (the
0x51 handshake, the two standby waits, the version header, three party blocks, the intro command stream
with its acks, one action selection) and ends the battle.

### Two rules not visible in the decomp

A block's size does not decide its path. A link buffer record with a 4-byte payload is exactly 16
bytes (every acknowledgement and every short command, including the first `GETMONDATA`), so routing any
two-fragment block into the trade LINKCMD path drops them. Inside a battle the state decides which path
a block takes, not its size.

An acknowledgement must never overtake the echo of the block it acknowledges. The parent's own
command and the child-slot echo share a frame, one echo per poll, so a two-fragment ack can pass a
seven-fragment echo. On the console the exec-flag bit is only *set* when its own block returns
[`MarkBattlerReceivedLinkData`, battle_util.c:193] and the host's ack *clears* it
[battle_controllers.c:585]:

    104.268 console bufferA battler 0 PRINTSTRING (72 B)
    104.366 US      ack battler 0                     <-- ours first
    104.383 echo    bufferA battler 0 PRINTSTRING

so the ack cleared a bit that was not set yet, the echo then set it, and the console waited forever for
an ack it had already received. It froze on the battle-end message with its network icon still
animating, the game loop and the link both alive, the battle script blocked on
`gBattleControllerExecFlags == 0`, which gates `Cmd_waitmessage` [battle_script_commands.c:2041].
`HostTradeEngine._echo_owed` holds a new block while any child command is still waiting to be mirrored
back.

`scratchpad/battle_blocks.py <host capture> [lo] [hi]` reassembles three streams (the console's blocks,
the host's, and the host's echo of the console's own commands) and prints each as a link buffer record
with which side still owes an acknowledgement. Run it on every battle capture.

### The pace is the RFU VBlank budget

The player sees roughly a second between each step of a link battle, in both directions. It is not a
defect and there is nothing to tune.

Datagram turnaround is not the cost: over one battle window `udp_in -> next udp_out` was median 5.8 ms,
p99 16.6 ms, max 17.9 ms across 8204 replies, and the console's own turnaround was median 8.1 ms. The
per-command cadence is identical across runs: median 800 ms between consecutive `bufferA` commands. A
console block is echoed in median 19 ms, but the host's corresponding block appears a median 355 ms
later.

That 355 ms is the RFU frame budget. `HostSession.tick` emits at most one RFU slot per call and is
driven at `HOST_VBLANK_SECONDS = 1/59.727` = 16.74 ms; measured, the outgoing inter-send gap is 17 ms for
5035 samples and 16 ms for 413. A controller command's block spans roughly twenty RFU frames, and twenty
frames at one per VBlank is ~340 ms; a full step is that plus the return leg, giving the observed
~800 ms.

Do not "optimise" the tick. Going faster means emitting more than one RFU slot per VBlank, which is
not what the hardware link does.

## What two real consoles put on the air

`cc6_air.pcap` is a passive capture of a trade between two real consoles (FireRed hosting through the
third NPC, LeafGreen joining) recorded with `scratchpad/legacy_linux/run_air.sh` while this project took no part in
the session.

Frame counts off a monitor interface are a floor, not a rate. The capture holds 9.5 data frames a
second; the beacon rate is no control for that, because beacons go out at 1 Mbit/s and data does not.
The 802.11 sequence counter is the control: every station numbers each frame it sends, so the gaps say
what the monitor missed. Only 19% of the hosting console's frames were captured in `cc6`, and 43% of
the same console's frames in `j84`.

Sequence-corrected, with the same console (`48:f1:eb:20:9b:22`) in both:

| station | talking to this project's host (`j84`) | talking to a real console (`cc6`) |
|---|---|---|
| the FireRed console | 161.8/s | 25.5/s |
| its peer | 58.9/s, our host at one slot per VBlank | 6.1/s, the LeafGreen |

A whole trade (party blocks, mail, animation, save barriers) runs between two consoles at 25 and 6
frames a second. The same console answers this project's 59/s tick with 162, six times what it sends a
real peer and nearly three times what it is being sent.

The GBA link inside the emulator is one slot per VBlank and that is not in question. What `cc6` measures
is the layer below: a real session does not put 60 datagrams a second on the air in either direction,
and ours does. The 25.5/s figure rests on the softest capture of the four.

`scratchpad/air_seqloss.py` prints the capture completeness per station and `scratchpad/air_rate.py`
the corrected send rates. Run both on any air capture before quoting a rate from it.

## The console's output rate is its own, not an echo of ours

`--tick-hz` sets how many RFU slots a second the host emits; the default is one per VBlank. It was added
to test whether the console's answer rate follows the host's, and the answer, measured on the same
console over two consecutive trades, is no:

| | 59.727 Hz (the default) | 20 Hz |
|---|---|---|
| host datagrams out | 79.3/s | 39.3/s |
| console datagrams in | 61.8/s | 51.8/s |
| trade duration | 92 s | 197 s |
| console datagrams, whole session | 5663 | 10218 |

Halving the host's output moved the console's by a sixth. Its pace is its own clock, and the only thing
that changed materially is that every step of the trade took proportionally longer, so the session
lasted 2.1x as long and the console sent 80% more datagrams in total. The player sees continuous lag.

Do not lower the tick. A slower host is not a quieter session; it is the same session stretched, with
more traffic and a longer exposure window. `--tick-hz` is an instrument, not a setting to tune, and the
approach of reducing our own send rate to make the console quieter is a measured dead end.

# The cable-club colosseum

`frlg_trade_host.py --colosseum` hosts Pokemon Center 2F → third NPC (club sans fil) → Colosseum →
Single Battle → JOIN.

Only `CB2_ReturnFromCableClubBattle` increments the Wonder Card's `battlesWon` [src/cable_club.c:792].
The in-room Union Room battle returns through `CB2_ReturnToField` and increments nothing, so the
Battle Count Card's prize is unreachable from every other activity.

The colosseum is the trade centre's entry with a battle at the end. `Task_StartActivity` treats
`ACTIVITY_BATTLE_SINGLE` and `ACTIVITY_TRADE` almost identically [union_room.c:1903]: both call
`CreateTrainerCardInBuffer(gBlockSendBuffer, TRUE)`, both `WarpForCableClubActivity` and both enter
`CB2_TransitionToCableClub`. Only the destination map differs (`MAP_BATTLE_COLOSSEUM_2P` at (6, 8)
instead of `MAP_TRADE_CENTER` at (5, 8)) plus a `HealPlayerParty()` the trade does not do. So the
100-byte trainer-card exchange, and with it `MysteryGift_TryEnableStatsByFlagId`, runs exactly as it does
for a trade: `--card-flag-id` arms the console's counters on this path too.

Four things change:

1. The advertised activity byte. The console searches with `LINK_GROUP_SINGLE_BATTLE`, whose accept
   list is `{ACTIVITY_BATTLE_SINGLE, 0xFF}` [src/data/union_room.h:398], so the trade beacon is invisible
   on that screen and vice versa. `build_colosseum_app_data` changes that byte and nothing else.
2. The spot, not the chair. `BattleColosseum_2P_EventScript_PlayerSpot0/1` has no party check at all
   [data/scripts/cable_club.inc:576]; the 4P colosseum's `ChooseHalfPartyForBattle` is the one with a
   selection step. The seat handshake is unchanged.
3. One more player record. `Task_StartWirelessCableClubBattle` case 2 sends
   `SendBlock(0, &gLocalLinkPlayer, sizeof(gLocalLinkPlayer))` [cable_club.c:701]: the bare 28-byte
   `struct LinkPlayer`, not the 60-byte LinkPlayerBlock of the entry, so its two GameFreak magics must
   not be added. There is no block request: both sides send unprompted and the console parks in case 3
   until every player's record has landed. Then 20 frames, an `IsLinkTaskFinished` wait, a
   `SetLinkStandbyCallback` and another wait (cases 4-6, the `REVISION >= 0xA` shape), and
   `CB2_InitBattle`.
4. The whole party fights. There is no two-mon selection, so `party_blocks` is called with the party
   as it stands rather than `SetUpPartiesAndStartBattle`'s two [union_room_battle.c:47].

From `CB2_InitBattle` on it is byte for byte the Union Room battle above, including the version signature
0x200. The one piece that does not appear is the 0x20-byte 0x51 selection block, which belongs to
`CB2_UnionRoomBattle` alone.

Two properties measured on hardware:

The seat needs the READY key and nothing else. With no movement sent at all (the host's avatar
standing at the door while the player walked to their own spot) the console faded to black and went on
to `Task_StartWirelessCableClubBattle`. `GetCableClubPartnersReady` reads link states alone
[overworld.c:2989], and the walk in `ENTRY_LEFT_CHAIR_ROUTE` is cosmetic.

The colosseum has no post-seat standby rounds. A host waiting for the trade centre's standby
sequence deadlocks: the console has already faded to black and parked in case 3 waiting for the record.
At 23.9 s the console sent `SEND_BLOCK_INIT` count 3 and the fragments
`04 40 00 80 65 df | bb c8 ff 00 11 00 | 01 00 03 00 00 00`, which is version 0x4004 (FireRed),
`lp_field_2` 0x8000 and its own trainer id: its `struct LinkPlayer`, ignored because the host was in the
wrong state to expect it. The entry is finished by that block's arrival, not by a standby count.

The exit is a handshake the host owes. Walking into the door runs `QueueExitLinkRoomKey`, which waits
for every player to reach `PLAYER_LINK_STATE_EXITING_ROOM` [`KeyInterCB_WaitForPlayersToExit`,
overworld.c:2977]. The trade centre answers that from `H_RETURN_FIELD`; after a battle the host is in the
battle state, so nobody answers and the console sits on *"conduire a la sortie de la piece, veuillez
patienter"* until the link errors. With the key taken from the battle states too, the console leaves the
room, closes the RFU link, and the host stops on its own.

## What decides whether a colosseum run counts

A forfeit is still a win for the console. `HandleAction_Run` in a link battle sets `B_OUTCOME_WON` on
the side that did not run and ORs in `B_OUTCOME_LINK_BATTLE_RAN` (1 << 7) [battle_main.c:4300]. That
extra bit would miss `CB2_ReturnFromCableClubBattle`'s `switch (gBattleOutcome) case B_OUTCOME_WON:`
entirely, except `HandleEndTurn_BattleWon` clears it first [battle_main.c:3734]. So the forfeit path
moves `battlesWon` and no real battle has to be lost.

Three wins need three `--id` values. The id recorded is
`gLinkPlayers[GetMultiplayerId() ^ 1].trainerId` [cable_club.c:794], which comes from the 28-byte record
above, and `IncrementCardStatForNewTrainer` counts each trainer id exactly once, remembering five per
stat [mystery_gift.c:630]. Three forfeits with three different ids took a console's `battlesWon` from 0 to
3 and the delivery man handed over the Battle Count Card's POTION, read back two independent ways:

    save 0x3434:  0100 0000 0000 2300    battlesWon 1, lost 0, trades 0, icon 35 CARD_TYPE_LINK_STAT
    game data:    "1 battles won"

# Two host-side constraints

The host's close path depends on the hole guard. `done` is set from the session's disconnect path,
gated on `disconnect_requested`, set by `_tick_close_link`, which only runs inside `activity.tick()`,
and `HostSession.tick` returns before calling `activity.tick()` while the hole guard holds. A console
that stops acknowledging latches the guard within a few frames and the clock that would release it
never advances. The runtime stops once the console has left LDN after a confirmed exit; a console
still in LDN but no longer acknowledging stalls the close timer behind the guard.

An all-zero `easyChatProfile` prints "??? ???" on the trainer card. Word 0 is
group `EC_GROUP_POKEMON_2` index 0 (`SPECIES_NONE`); `IsECWordInvalid` rejects it and `CopyEasyChatWord`
substitutes `gText_ThreeQuestionMarks` [easy_chat.c:166-171]. A word is
`(group & 0x7F) << 9 | (index & 0x1FF)` [easy_chat.h:1089] and the card holds four [trainer_card.h:28]. A
short phrase pads with `EC_WORD_UNDEFINED` (0xFFFF), which prints nothing.
