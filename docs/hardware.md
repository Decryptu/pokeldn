# Hardware and setup

Speaking LDN needs an adapter the kernel will put into AP mode and keep there.

| symptom | cause |
|---|---|
| a hypervisor-style USB disconnect at AP start | the USB mode switch; see [Adapters](hardware_adapters.md) |
| a silent host | `accept_decrypted_ccmp` unset |
| `failed to get tx report from firmware` in `dmesg` | the host's own teardown |
