`scripts/gen_leafgreen_twins.py`, from the windows both cartridges have been dumped at. A `bl` is a
relative call, so the same instruction resolves to a different address on each cartridge and the
pair is two measurements rather than one plus a delta; a literal-pool word is the same for data.
Nothing here is interpolated: an address absent from this table has not been measured, and
`leafgreen()` falls back to `rom_map.leafgreen_guess`, which applies the segment delta and refuses
inside a boundary.

The segment map is built from these pairs: 1863 points quantised into seven deltas with no outlier.
