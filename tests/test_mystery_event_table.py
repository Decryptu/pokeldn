"""Locating gMysteryEventScriptCmdTable, the one table this project has only ever read from the
decomp.

The Mystery Event VM has its own 17-command interpreter [docs/frlg_rom.md]. Every opcode in it
has been RUN on the console, but the table itself has never been located: it carries no constant to
search for, and its 17 entries are unrelated function addresses, so `table-scan`'s arithmetic-run
fingerprint does not match it either.

What does match is where the table's ADDRESS is kept. `InitMysteryEventScript` calls
`InitScriptContext(ctx, gMysteryEventScriptCmdTable, gMysteryEventScriptCmdTableEnd)`
[decomp:src/mystery_event_script.c:52], `struct ScriptContext` stores those two as ADJACENT words
at +0x5C and +0x60 [decomp:include/script.h], and the context is
`EWRAM_DATA static struct ScriptContext sMysteryEventScriptContext` - so once a Mystery Event script
has run, the pair sits in EWRAM for the rest of the boot.

Two adjacent words exactly 68 apart is a `table-scan` with `--table-delta 0x44 --table-runlen 2`,
and the scan answers with the run's first VALUE, which is the table address itself. Locating and
reading are one run, the same way gSpecialVars was.
