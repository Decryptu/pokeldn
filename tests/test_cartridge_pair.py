"""Pairing the two cartridges' copies of one window, and the delta map that comes out of it.

A run made this measurement without naming it: a POINTER dumped off both consoles is a delta point
at wherever it points. `tools/frlg/cartridge_pair.py` reads both kinds out of a window held on both
cartridges - the literal-pool words, which sessions 40 and 41 paired by hand, and the `bl` targets,
which nothing had. A `bl` is a RELATIVE call, so the same instruction resolves to a different
address on each cartridge and the pair is two measurements rather than one plus an assumed delta.

WHAT SAYS THE PAIRING IS REAL: every site pairs, and the deltas come out quantised. 734 of 734 and
834 of 834 across the two 16 KB pairs, four delta values each, no outliers. The first version of the
tool computed the LeafGreen offsets off the FireRed base and answered with 64 deltas, none repeated -
which is what a misplaced window looks like and why the count is checked.

TWO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATIONS, from runs that knew nothing about this: the pairing puts LeafGreen's
`AddBagItem` at 0x0809DA44 and `Random` at 0x080486B0, both where they were measured
independently.
