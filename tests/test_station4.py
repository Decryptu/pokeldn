"""The version-4 connection request, against Sword's own serializer.

Every offset here was read off `main` 0x017c7aa0 (the serializer) and checked against 0x017c62a0
(the parser that reads the same bytes back). There is no capture of one, so what these tests can
prove is that the bytes land where those two functions put them and that a version-4 request is
NOT a 5.27 request - which is the mistake that would cost a run and read as ordinary silence.
