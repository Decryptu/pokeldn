"""Naming the workers from the decomp's call order, and the two cartridges not being mixed.

A run read a handler's workers off a 1 KB window by hand: every ScrCmd body is
`VarGet(ScriptReadHalfword(ctx))` per argument and then one call, so the `bl`s come out in the
decomp's own call order and name themselves. The same method named three more
tables. `scripts/gen_worker_names.py` is that reading mechanised, and these are the checks that
decide whether what it produces is evidence: evaluation order, the right preprocessor branch, an
equal call count, an anchor that lands back on its own name, callers that agree, and the link
script's own order over the whole ROM.

THE BUG THESE TESTS EXIST FOR: `--with-every-dump` folded 16 KB of LeafGreen
into the same image as the FireRed dumps. LeafGreen keeps that code at FireRed's address minus 0x2C,
so the image answered with whichever cartridge's copy it had placed there, and a body read out of
the wrong one calls that cartridge's workers. It named nothing wrong only because the anchor check
threw those bodies out - `AddBagItem` came back 0x2C low - but it is where most of "127 call targets
with no name" came from.
