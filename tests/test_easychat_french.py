"""The French Easy Chat vocabulary, and the two independent ways it was established.

An Easy Chat id is `(group << 9) | index` - a SLOT. `easychat_words` is generated from the
ENGLISH decomp, so it names the slot and not what a French console prints in it. Two things say
what the console prints, and they were gathered completely differently:

  * a RENDER: ids put into a mail or a script and read off the console's screen by the player. One slot at a time, and it needs a human eye.
  * the ROM TABLE: sEasyChatGroup_* read out of the cartridge with `--buffer-script
    string-gather`: the table was found by its own count fingerprint, then read, then the words
    read the words). A whole group per run, and it is the data the game itself indexes.

Neither is worth much alone. Together they are: where they overlap they must agree, and this
file is what enforces that.
